# Medical AI Pneumonia Diagnosis System

## End-to-End Deep Learning, Visual Language Model, and Retrieval Prototype

**AlfaisalX: Cognitive Robotics & Autonomous Agents – Technical Challenge**

---

## 1. Project Overview

This project presents a complete end-to-end Artificial Intelligence system for automated analysis of chest X-ray images.

The system integrates three modern AI components:

- Image classification (diagnosis)  
- Medical report generation (radiology-style text)  
- Content-based image retrieval (similar case search)  

The objective is not only to train a neural network, but to demonstrate how multiple AI technologies can be combined into a functional medical decision-support prototype.

The system was developed using the **PneumoniaMNIST dataset (MedMNIST v2)** and implemented entirely in Python using PyTorch and HuggingFace models.

---

## 2. System Capabilities

Given a chest X-ray image, the system can:

- Detect whether pneumonia is suspected  
- Visualize important regions using Explainable AI (Grad-CAM)  
- Generate an automatic medical report using a visual-language model  
- Retrieve visually similar X-ray cases from the dataset  

This mimics a simplified real-world clinical workflow.

## 3. Dataset

- **Dataset:** PneumoniaMNIST (MedMNIST v2)  
- **Binary classification:** Normal vs Pneumonia  
- **Training images:** ~4,700  
- **Validation images:** ~500  
- **Test images:** ~600  
- **Image size:** 28×28 grayscale  

Install automatically:

```bash
pip install medmnist

## 4. Model Architecture (Task 1 – Classification)

We used a Vision Transformer (ViT) as the primary classifier.

### Preprocessing

* CLAHE contrast enhancement
* Normalization
* Data augmentation (rotation, flip)

### Training Configuration

* Epochs: 5
* Optimizer: Adam
* Loss Function: Cross-Entropy Loss
* Framework: PyTorch

### Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score
* Confusion Matrix
* ROC Curve

### Performance

| Metric    | Value  |
| --------- | ------ |
| Accuracy  | 86.38% |
| Precision | 82.24% |
| Recall    | 99.74% |
| F1-Score  | 90.15% |

## 5. Explainable AI (Grad-CAM)

To improve interpretability, Grad-CAM heatmaps were generated to highlight regions influencing model predictions.

The model mainly focused on lung opacity regions in pneumonia cases, indicating clinically meaningful behavior.

---

## 6. Medical Report Generation (Task 2 – VLM)

A visual-language model (LLaVA / Med-style prompting) was used to automatically produce a radiology-style report.

The model receives:

* X-ray image
* Clinical prompt

And outputs a natural language medical description including suspicion of pneumonia.

### Sample prompt:

> "You are a radiologist. Analyze this chest X-ray and write a concise medical report. State if pneumonia is suspected."

---

## 7. Semantic Image Retrieval (Task 3 – CBIR)

A content-based image retrieval system is implemented using image embeddings and vector similarity search (FAISS).

### Capabilities:

* Image-to-Image search
* Retrieval of most similar cases
* Visualization of top-k matches

This simulates a clinical “similar cases” reference system.
